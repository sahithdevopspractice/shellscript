#!/bin/bash:--  this is the first line in shell script to start with, this is called shebang, to check the sysntax of our schell script,  we need to give the location of the bash,

bash scipt and shell script both are same, first line should be she bang to exicute and check the syntax of our script, we need to give the location of shebang in the first line.

echo is the command to print somehting in the schell script.
example:- echo "hello world"

VARIABLES:- is a powerfull concept in programming, which will be used to don't repeat yourself DRY.
----------
DRY:- don't repeat yourself.

So here in schell script also we do have varibles concept,
syntax is VAIABLE_NAME=VALUE
example:- PERSON1=RAMESH
          PERSON2=SURESH
        Note:- No spaces, if you give spaces then it will be a syntax error.
So variables will if you change at one location it will change every where in the script.

Q)-- HOW DO YOU RUN COMMANDS IN SHELL SCRIPT AND WILL TAKE OUTPUTS?
$(<command>)

DATA TYPES:-
-----------
Generally we have diffeent types of data types in programming language like java, c++, those are like int, string, char, float, boolean, array, arraylist etc.
Here in shell script it will take the data type automaticaaly, except array's.

Install Mysql using shell script:-
1- Check user is root or not?
2-- if root proceed, if not root stop and send error, run with root user.
3-- now install Mysql
4-- check instaledd properly or not
5-- if success
      then good
    if not successed
      then show what is the error.
so how to check root user or not?
run the command id, for root users uid is always 0, if uid is not zero, then it is not a root user.
SHELL script don't stop if there is an error, it will proceed further.
It is our responsibility to check and proceed.
